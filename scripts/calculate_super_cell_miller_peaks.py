"""
This script calculates the diffraction peaks for GaAs, first for the unit cell, and 
then for a 1*1*1, 2*2*2 and 3*3*3 super cell. 
It prints the deflection angle, miller indices and relative intensity of each peak for 
the cells above.
The purpose of this script is ensure that the super cell implementation is valid - the 
miller peaks for all of the cells should be identical.
